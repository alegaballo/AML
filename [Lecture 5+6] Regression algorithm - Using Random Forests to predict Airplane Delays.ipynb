    "# 1. Decision trees and Random Forests: Simple but Powerful Algorithms\n",
    "> Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future. (Niels Bohr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a very popular approach to prediction problems. Decision trees can be trained from both categorical and numerical features, to perform classification and regression. Classification and regression are the oldest and most well-studied types of predictive analytics. In many analytics packages and libraries, most algorithms are devoted either to address classification or regression problems, and they include for example support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and deep learning...\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, classification refers to the problem of predicting a label, or category, like *spam/not spam*, *rainy/sunny/mild*, for some given data. Regression refers to predicting a numeric quantity like salary, temperature, delay time, product's price. Both classification and regression involve predicting one (or more) values given one (or more) other input values. They require labelled data to perform a training phase, which builds the statistical model: they belong to *supervised learning* techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Feature definition\n",
    "To understand how regression and classification operate, it is necessary to briefly define the terms that describe their input and output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we want to predict the temperature of tomorrow given today's weather information.\n",
    "The weather information is a loose concept. For example, we can use many variables to express today's weather such as:\n",
    "* the average humidity today\n",
    "* today’s high temperature\n",
    "* today’s low temperature \n",
    "* wind speed\n",
    "* outlook: e.g. cloudy, rainy, or clear\n",
    "* ....\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are called *features* or *demensions*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each variable can be quantified. For example, high and low temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius, humidity can be measured as a fraction between 0 and 1, and weather type can be labeled `cloudy`, `rainy` or `clear`...\n",
    "So, the weather today can be expressed by a list of values: `11.4, 18.0, 0.64, 20, cloudy`\n",
    "Each feature is also called a `predictor`. Together, they constitute a `feature vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature whose domain is a set of categories is called **categorical feature**. In our example, `outlook` is a  categorical feature. A feature whose values are numerical is called **numerical feature**. In our example, `temperature` is a numerical feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, tomorrow's temperature, that is what we want to predict, is called *target feature*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Decision Trees & Random Forests\n",
    "The first question that you might ask is: \"Why Decision trees and not another approach?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the literature shows that the family of algorithms known as decision trees can naturally handle both categorical and numeric features. The training process is easy to understand. The model is easy to interpret. They are robust to outliers in the data, meaning that a few extreme and possibly erroneous data points should not affect the tree at all. The model can be trained in parallel easily. The accuracy is comparable to other methods... In short, there are lots of advantages when using decision trees with respect to other methods! \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we use a tree model is very simple to understand. We can say that this process \"mimics\" the way humans take decisions. For example, to decide whether to play football or not, a natural questions would be \"does it rain now ?\". If yes, the decision is `no`. If it's sunny, the condition is favorable to play football. A second natural question could be: \"is it windy?\". If no, then you may want to stay at home because otherwise it is going to be too hot. Otherwise, a third plausible question could be: \"do we have enough people?\". If no, then there's no point playing. Otherwise, time to play!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a decision tree allows to follow a similar process to that described above (see the image below). Given a new input, the algorithm traverses the tree in a such a way that the input satisfies the condition of each node until reaching a leaf one. The value of the leaf node is the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A decision tree](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1690/24308350756_8533286fb5_z.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree model in the figure is built from historical information concerning many past days. The `feature predictor` contains three features: Rain, Is_Windy, Enough_People.\n",
    "An example of the training data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rain | Is_Windy | Enough_People | Play\n",
    "-----|----------|---------------|------\n",
    "Yes | Yes | No | No\n",
    "No  | No | No | No\n",
    "No | Yes | Yes | Yes\n",
    "No | No | Yes | No\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, in the training data, we know the values of predictors and we also know the corresponding answer: we have the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of decision trees is that it's easy to incur in overfitting problems. In other words, the model is too fit to the training data, it is too precise and not general enough. So, when testing the quality of predictions with different testing sets, accuracy could fluctuate. To overcome this limitation, the tree can be pruned after it is built, or even be pruned during the training process. Another approach is building a `Random Decision Forest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Random Decision Forest`, as its name implies, is a forest of random Decision trees. Each tree element is built randomly from the training data. Randomization generally applies to:\n",
    "* Building new training data: Random selectiion of samples from the training data (with replacement) from the original training data\n",
    "* When building a node: Random selection of a subset of features\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a decision, the forest \"asks\" all trees about their prediction, and then chooses the outcome which is the most voted."

    "# 2. Usecase : Flights delay prediction\n",
    "## 2.1 Context\n",
    "Every day, in US, there are thousands of flights departures and arrivals: unfortunately, as you may have noticed yourself, flight delays are not a rare event!! Now, given historical data about flights in the country, including the delay information that was computed *a-posteriori* (so the ground truth is available), we want to build a model that can be used to predict how many minutes of delay a flight might experience in the future. This model should provide useful information for the airport to manage better its resources, to minimize the delays and their impact on the jurney of its passengers. Alternatively, astute passengers could even use the model to choose the best time for flying, such as to avoid delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Data\n",
    "The data we will use in this notebook has been collected by the RITA (Research and Inovative Technology Administration), and it contains details facets about each air flight that happened in the US between 1987 and 2008. It includes 29 variables such as the origin airport, the destination airport, the scheduled departured time, day, month, the arrival delay... For more information, please visit the following [link](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html), that provides a lot of detail on the data.

    "The data has 29 features, that can be either categorical or numerical. For example, the `src_airport` (source airport) is categorical: there exist no comparision operator between airport names. We can not say \"SGN is bigger than NCE\". The departure is numerical, for which a comparison operator exists. For instance, \"flight departing before 6PM\" can be express by \"departure_time < 1800\".\n",

    "In this usecase, most features are numerical, except `carier`, `flight_number`, `cancelled`, `cancelation_code` and `diverted`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains a header, that is useless in building the statistical model. In addition, we already know the data schema, so we can safely neglect it. Note that there are some features with missing values in some lines of the dataset. The missing values are marked by \"NA\". These values can cause problems when processing and can lead to unexpected results. Therefore, we need to remove the header and replace all \"NA\" values by empty values, such as they can be interpreted as null values.\n",

    "Next, we will focus on using DataFrames. However, to use DataFrames, the data must be clean (no invalid values). That means we can not create DataFrame directly from the \"RAW\" data. Instead, we will first create an RDD from RAW data, produce a new, clean RDD, then transform it to a DataFrame and work on it. The RDD `cleaned_data` is an RDD[String]. We need to transform it to RDD[(TypeOfColumn1, TypeOfColumn2,.., TypeOfColumn29)] then call a function to create a DataFrame from the new RDD.\n"

    "Now that we have a good grasp on our data and its features, we will focus on how build a statistic model. Note that the features we can decide to use, to train our model, can be put in two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explicit features**: these are features that are present in the original data, or that can be built using additional data sources such as `weather` (for example querying a public API)\n",
    "- **Implicit features**: these are the features that are inferred from other features such as `is_weekend`, `is_holiday`, `season`, `in_winter`,...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the following predictors: `year`, `month`, `day_of_month`, `day_of_week`, `scheduled_departure_time`, `scheduled_arrival_time`, `carrier`, `is_weekend`, `distance`, `src_airport`, `dest_airport`. Among them, `is_weekend` is an implicit feature. The rest are explicit features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target feature is `arrival_delay`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, MLLIB only supports building models from RDDs. It is important to read well the documentation and the MLLib API, to make sure to use the algorithms in an appropriate manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MLLIB supports both categorical and numerical features. However, for each categorical feature, we have to indicate how many distinct values they can take\n",
    "- Each training record must be a ```LabelledPoint```. This datastructure has 2 components: ```label``` and ```predictor vector```. ```label``` is the value of target feature in the current record. ```predictor vector``` is a vector of values of type ```Double```. As such, we need to map each value of each categorical feature to a number. In this project, we choose a naïve approach: map each value to an unique index. \n",
    "- MLLIB uses a binning technique to find the split point (the predicate in each tree node). In particular, it divides the domain of numerical features into ```maxBins``` bins (32 by default). With categorical features, each distinct value fits in its own bin. **IMPORTANT:** MLLIB requires that no categorical feature have more than `maxBins` distinct values.\n",
    "- We fill up the missing values in each **categorical** feature with it's most common value. The missing values of a **numerical** feature are also replaced by the most common value (however, in some cases, a more sensible approach would be to use the median of this kind of feature).\n"
